* LAUNCH THE GAME BY SELECTING THE PROGRAM TETRIS *


This is a Tetris Clone for the TI-83+ coded in ASM.

This was my first time in ASM and it poorly written (the source are included) but the graphics are great (I think).

The game is separate in two differents program, TETRIS (Launcher coded in Basic) and TETRISJD (ASM game).
You can either play by launching TETRIS or enter the command Asm(TETRISJD.

I use two differents programs because when I included the Highscore feature, my tetris game just crash (it happen too when there was a Tetris Logo splash screen).
Oddly, it wasn't the code but it seem as if the program was getting to big (?), so the Highscore feature is now written as a separate program.


This game doesn't need any OS at all and should work juste fine on any TI-83+ (And possibly other Calc ?).

All piece are included, custom skin for each of them, speed increase at each level, highscore, etc. Anything you could expects for a Tetris game except no Music.


Control :

Enter : Pause - Confirm

Left and Right Arrows : Move Piece Horizontaly

Down : Increase speed of the piece (Temporary)

Up or Graph : Turn piece clockwise

Trace : Turn Piece anti-clockwise

Clear : Exit Game (Save Highscore but not the game)
